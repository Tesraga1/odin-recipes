                </li>

            <li>

                2 tablespoons sliced green onions
                </li>
            <li>

                1 teaspoon kosher salt
                </li>
            <li>

                1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
                </li>
            <li>

                1 cup all-purpose flour
                </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat and add sausage. Cook and stir, breaking up chunks with a spatula, until browned and crumbly, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium, add onions and a pinch of salt, and cook, stirring, until onions start to turn soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in butter, and once melted, add flour. Cook, stirring, for about 2 minutes. Add diced apple, and cook, stirring for another minute or so.</li>
            <li>Pour in chicken broth, raise heat to high, and stir with a spoon, scraping up all the browned bits (fond) from the bottom. Add milk and bring mixture to a simmer. Reduce heat to between medium and medium-low, and simmer for about 15 minutes. For thicker gravy, mixture can be reduced further. Reduce heat to medium-low and prepare dumpling batter.</li>
            <li>Combine egg, cider, creme fraiche, thyme, 2 tablespoons green onions, 1 teaspoon salt, and baking powder in a bowl and whisk thoroughly. Add 1 cup flour and whisk just until flour disappears. Clean off whisk with a spatula, and scrape down the sides of the bowl, mixing in any visible flour. Set batter aside until needed.</li>
            <li>Stir gravy and taste for seasoningâ€”add more salt if needed, plus freshly ground black pepper, cayenne, 1/4 cup green onions, and 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li>Raise heat to medium, and transfer generous, rounded teaspoons of dumpling batter on top of the simmering gravy.</li>
            <li>Cover, and let cook, untouched, until dumplings are puffed up, and floating on top, 5 to 6 minutes. A skewer inserted into the center of a dumpling should come out clean. Serve immediately topped with additional green onions if desired.</li>
        </ol>
